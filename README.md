Scripts for processing DPGP and DGRP data for evolutionary analyses

Drosophila melangoaster population genomic re-sequence data was downloaded from the Drosophila Genome Nexus database http://www.johnpool.net/genomes.html

Data for DPGP2 using the following command:

`wget http://pooldata.genetics.wisc.edu/dpgp2_sequences.tar.bz2`

Data for the DPGP project was obtained using the following command:

`wget http://pooldata.genetics.wisc.edu/dgrp_sequences.tar.bz2`
